# chessbot
Online Web App where users play against a chess bot.

We are splitting up the game into three parts, 
  - the early game
  - the mid game
  - the end game

To tackle the early game we will program the chess bot to cycle through some standard openings. 
The mid game will be the most challengings as we 
We consider it to be the end game when there are less than 8 peices left on the board.
For this we will then use the tablebases of all possible moves left.
